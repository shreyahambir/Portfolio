            <p class="body-text">I grew up in Cupertino, CA with my parents and am currently a sophomore at Cal Poly. I’m majoring in graphic communications and plan to concentrate in User Experience and Interface. I also hope to minor in Media, Arts, and Technology. Some of my hobbies are watching movies, writing, and playing guitar.

            <h2>Photoshop: Colors</h2><p class="body-text">For this Photoshop project, I changed the color of the butterfly in the photo below from orange to blue and the color of the flower from pink to white using selection masks. </p>
            <img src="assets/images/butterfly_before.png" alt="butterfly before" class="center" />
            <img src="assets/images/butterfly_after.png" alt="butterfly after" class="center" />
            <h2>Photoshop: Composites</h2><p class="body-text">My next project was a composite of two images of a fish and a bird onto one background.I chose these images beacuse I thought the idea of morphing an animal that flies with one that swims was interesting.  </p>

            <h2>Illustrator: Brushes </h2><p class="body-text"> In Illustrator, I made this fun and simple summer-themed design that can be used as a background or wallpaper, utilizing custom brushes. </p>
            <img src="assets/images/brushes.png" alt="icons" class="icons" />
            
            <h2>Illustrator: Cards</h2><p class="body-text"> One of my favorite projects I've done during my time at Cal Poly so far is making a full box of cards using Illustrator and InDesign. I enjoyed how much room for creativity there was in the design process. Here is my design for the back of the cards and the four suits. </p>

            <h2>InDesign: Brochure</h2><p class="body-text"> I've done a lot of projects in InDesign through freelancing and my major, but my favorite and the most relevant right now is this brochure I created regarding COVID-19. </p>
